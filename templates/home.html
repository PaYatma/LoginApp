            The MD Clinicals Database is a digital repository that has been in operation since 2022 the documents 
            and acts as a search tool for employees and clients. It contains detailed information about
            that must be submitted in order to begin pre- and/or post-market clinical trials of
            Medical Devices. </br>
            It preserves information for the EU, Southeast Asia, and America, and we hope to expand to all
            territories in the future. One of our missions is to ensure that data is collected, stored,
            and used in a fair, transparent, lawful, limited-purpose, and accurate manner.
